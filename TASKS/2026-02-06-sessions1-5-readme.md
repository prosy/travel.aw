# travel.aw — Codex Parallel Session Packages (Day-1)

Use one branch per session and keep **scope lock** strict to avoid merge conflicts.

Merge order:
1) contracts+db
2) ui
3) maps
4) searchlinks/agent
5) email ingest

Rule: If an out-of-scope change seems required, add a TODO comment instead of editing the file.

```
