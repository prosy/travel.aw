# Agent State — 2026-02-24

## Completed This Session

- Built Seattle deterministic RAG scaffold (non-vector): categories, places/events datasets, query triggers, and query tooling.
- Bootstrapped local Next.js web shell at `apps/web` and implemented Seattle routes:
  - `/seattle`
  - `/seattle/planning`
  - `/seattle/while-in-seattle`
  - `/seattle/while-in-seattle/sports`
- Added deterministic APIs:
  - `/api/seattle/query`
  - `/api/seattle/sports` (stored-query backed, compact response)
- Added UI/UX pass to match app style: top nav active states, tabs/cards, pills, sticky query-state side panels.
- Added sports page auto-fire behavior (page-open stored query call) and concise rendering (summary + selected table).
- Fixed runtime issue for Next.js 16: `searchParams` must be awaited in server pages before property access.

## Commit SHAs

- `HEAD` — `chore(travel.aw): session close — Seattle MVP + handoff brief` (resolve with `git rev-parse --short HEAD`)

## Next Actions

1. Run both local services and do final browser QA pass (`Seattle_wikidata` + `apps/web` on `3010`).
2. Decide production integration path into broader travel.aw IA/nav (or keep Seattle as isolated feature module first).
3. Optional cleanup: set Next.js `turbopack.root` to silence multi-lockfile warning.
4. Open PR from this commit and request review.

## Open Blockers

- None.
