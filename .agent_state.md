# Agent State — 2026-02-24

## Completed This Session

- **M0 DoD e2e test:** Submitted PR #1 to prosy/travel-aw-skills with 2 test skills
  - `test-echo` — minimal clean skill, expected to PASS all gates
  - `test-echo-bad` — deliberately triggers TRAVEL-001 (hardcoded email) + TRAVEL-003 (C-BOOKING-TXN + low risk)
- Local validation confirmed: test-echo exit 0, test-echo-bad exit 1, existing 4/4 fixtures still pass
- StopCrabs local scan: test-echo passes clean (exit 0, 1 review-only finding)
- **CI results (PR #1, run 22334992847):**
  - `Validate skill.yaml`: PASS — both skills have valid manifests
  - `Travel Domain Rules`: FAIL (expected) — test-echo passes, test-echo-bad blocked with TRAVEL-001 + TRAVEL-003
  - `StopCrabs Scan`: FAIL (unexpected) — `pip install stopcrabs>=0.2.0` fails on public PyPI (package not publicly available)
  - PR comment posted with per-skill markdown output confirming gate differentiation
- **M0 DoD assessment:** 2 of 3 gates proven end-to-end. StopCrabs gate has infrastructure issue (private PyPI) but logic is verified locally.

## Commit SHAs

- `05a114d` — feat(m0-dod): e2e test skills — test-echo (pass) + test-echo-bad (fail) (prosy/travel-aw-skills)

## Next Actions

1. **Fix StopCrabs CI:** Package needs to be published to PyPI or CI needs private index URL configured. Without this, StopCrabs gate always fails in CI.
2. **M0-B2 (deferred):** Fork NanoClaw → prosy/nanoclaw (mechanical, non-blocking)
3. **Track B:** V1 web app security hardening (B1–B6 from Combined PRD). Unpause Supabase project when ready.
4. **WP-4 (optional):** Graph export (Neo4j/CSV, browse UI)

## Open Blockers

- StopCrabs package not available on public PyPI — CI gate fails at install step. Local verification passes. Needs either: (a) publish to PyPI, (b) configure private index in CI, or (c) vendor the package.

## Key Findings

- StopCrabs is not on public PyPI — CI `pip install stopcrabs>=0.2.0` fails with "No matching distribution found"
- Travel domain rules gate works perfectly in CI: per-skill markdown output distinguishes pass/fail
- Manifest validation gate correctly passes both skills (no wildcard domains)
