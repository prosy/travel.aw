# Agent State — 2026-02-25 (Session close update)

## Completed This Session

- Re-ran Track B4/B6 execution against the correct app repo path: `/Users/blackcat/Projects/augmented-worlds/travel`.
- Created dedicated branches and commits:
  - `track-b-b4-encryption` → `983f1fd` (B4 follow-up migration/script updates)
  - `track-b-b6-repo-drift` → `7cdcd74` (B6 packageManager alignment)
- Verified builds and migration script behavior:
  - `npx next build` passed for both B4 and B6 verification passes.
  - `npx tsx scripts/migrate-encrypt-existing.ts` dry-run passed and printed summary counts.
  - `npx prisma migrate dev --name add_encryption_iv_fields` failed with `P3006` on shadow DB replay (documented in report).
- Wrote completion reports to governance repo:
  - `prod_plans/TB_B4_COMPLETION_REPORT.md`
  - `prod_plans/TB_B6_COMPLETION_REPORT.md`
- Copied both completion reports to `~/Downloads/`.

## Next Actions (priority order)

1. Push `track-b-b4-encryption` and `track-b-b6-repo-drift` branches if not yet pushed.
2. Validate whether B4/B6 are merged into canonical Track B branch strategy (`track-b-security` vs PR-based per-task branches).
3. Merge PR #1 (`travel-aw-skills`) and PR #4 (`travel.aw`) after Auth0 e2e verification.
4. In deployment environment, set `WEBHOOK_EMAIL_SECRET` and `ENCRYPTION_KEY`.
5. Run encryption backfill in target environment: `npx tsx scripts/migrate-encrypt-existing.ts --execute`.
